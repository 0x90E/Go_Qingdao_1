.CO Internet, S.A.S., the Administrator for .CO, has collected this
information for the WHOIS database through Accredited Registrars.  
This information is provided to you for informational purposes only 
and is designed to assist persons in determining contents of a domain 
name registration record in the .CO Internet registry database. .CO 
Internet makes this information available to you "as is" and does not 
guarantee its accuracy.
 
By submitting a WHOIS query, you agree that you will use this data 
only for lawful purposes and that, under no circumstances will you 
use this data:  (1) to allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission 
of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations via direct 
mail, electronic mail, or by telephone; (2) in contravention of any 
applicable data and privacy protection laws; or (3) to enable high volume, 
automated,  electronic processes that apply to the registry (or its systems). 
Compilation, repackaging, dissemination, or other use of the WHOIS 
database in its entirety, or of a substantial portion thereof, is not allowed 
without .CO Internet's prior written permission. .CO Internet reserves the 
right to modify or change these conditions at any time without prior or 
subsequent notification of any kind. By executing this query, in any manner 
whatsoever, you agree to abide by these terms.  In some limited cases, 
domains that might appear as available in whois might not actually be 
available as they could be already registered and the whois not yet updated 
and/or they could be part of the Restricted list. In this cases, performing a 
check through your Registrar's (EPP check) will give you the actual status 
of the domain. Additionally, domains currently or previously used as 
extensions in 3rd level domains will not be available for registration in the 
2nd level. For example, org.co,mil.co,edu.co,com.co,net.co,nom.co,arts.co,
firm.co,info.co,int.co,web.co,rec.co,co.co. 
 
NOTE: FAILURE TO LOCATE A RECORD IN THE WHOIS DATABASE IS NOT 
INDICATIVE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A DOMAIN NAME.   
 
All domain names are subject to certain additional domain name registration 
rules. For details, please visit our site at www.cointernet.co <http://www.cointernet.co>.
